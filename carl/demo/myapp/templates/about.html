<h1 class="pt-5">ðŸ‘‹ About Me</h1>
<p>Good day, I'm Carl Andre Interino a 2nd Year Computer Science Student. Since I was a kid I always thought of how the web works and how to make one, back then I don't have a computer or a laptop It's because of financial problems but now I have the materials needed in my journey but the only thing that I'm weak at is discipline and patience, hoping that this year I will learn and gain new skills in terms of programming.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>
My mission is to learn enough before getting a job. I aim to be a Web Developer particularly a Front-End Developer. This year I will learn the necessary things to be a Front-End Dev. Hoping that you and the people around me witness the challenges that I will be encountering.
